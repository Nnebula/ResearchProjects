Questions about Self Avoiding Chain:

1- segments mean the spacing betwwen particles? different naming from phantom chain routine

2- what is the segment length here: you mentioend it's 1.1 times the hardcore diameter. and in the initialize considered 1.2 as the segment length. 

3- how to choose the hard core diamater? (what value?)

4- in teh revised version, the end points are not configured (in the initialize function)

5- what number to choose for ds? displacement of each particle in each step? 

6- a general question: how to choose values for constants in the code?

7- in lookup function why do you define another rmax? is it the same as TMAX? shouldn't it be the minimum allowd amount? rather than the maximum tether length?
8- for hardcore testing in position function why the minimum value is one? 

9- why the spacings (minimum and maximum seperations) are not defiend as harmonic spring?

10-
 about the testing force part in position function: what is dw? work done by the last particle or work done on the last particle and why?
